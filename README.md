## Known issues
    Are there fundamental design limitations that users should be aware of?
    Are there specific bugs, glitches, or shortcomings that users should be aware of?

## Societal impact
    Our game is currently inaccessible to visually-impaired or blind players.
    This is because it does not use sound effects and is designed around the player's ability to see what is happening onscreen.
    Our game also requires keyboard input, so those unable to press keys will require an accessibility aid to play.
